While not wide-spread, some Android devices experience issues where the Accessibility services that allow apps to "talk" to each other in the background keeps shutting off intermittently.

This is a bug within Android itself and impacts any apps that use Accessibility services to perform specialized tasks - not just Accountable2You.
So while we can’t fix the bug in Android’s code, if you have one of the affected devices and have noticed that Accountable2You accessibility occasionally disables itself, the solution below typically fixes the problem.


Solution: Allow Accountable2You to run in the background without battery restrictions 
If your Android device is disabling Accessibility services, it is most likely the result of an overly-eager battery saver functionality built into the device. To remedy this, we’ll need to prevent Android from closing Accountable2You in the background.

# Step 1: Reenable Accessibility services on your device
On your device, open Settings > Accessibility
Scroll until you find Accountable2You. Tap on Accountable2You
Toggle Accessibility to Off and then On again (it may show as on but be disabled).

# Step 2: Create an exclusion within your task manager or cleaner app
If you've installed a third-party app to clean your phone or stop running background processes, you'll need to make an exclusion for Accountable2You. Contact the support team for that specific app to receive guidance on how to create an app exclusion. 

Haven't installed a device cleaner or task manager? Go ahead and proceed to the next step! 

# Step 3: Turn off battery optimization for Accountable2You 
Changing the battery optimization settings varies between each device, so we've written this guide that covers how to do this for most models:
